\abstract {
Consumer implementations of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are rapidly becoming possible due to the proliferation and ubiquity of smartphones, tablets, and other portable computers. However, the combination of wireless communication, device mobility, and the self-organizing nature of MANETs presents a challenging environment for developing distributed applications. Networking middleware and libraries for MANET applications typically provide adaptations of traditional distributed computing paradigms designed for wired networks. In this work we quantitatively evaluate existing projects and their fundamental underlying communication paradigms using real applications in realistic MANET environments. We then propose and evaluate a new communication paradigm specifically designed for MANETs.
